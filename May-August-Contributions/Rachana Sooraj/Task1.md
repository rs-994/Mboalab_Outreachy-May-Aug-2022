The objective of this task is to design the data collection system that will be use to collect thyphoid fever clinical data 
(symptoma variables that will allow us not only to confirm the diagnosis but above all to determine the level of severity of the disease).

As part of this task I have created a google form that asks a series of questions and stores the answers in a google spreadsheet.

I feel that having patients to respond to 'Yes' or 'No' questions would be more helpful than having them access the severity of each symptom they have. For example, a patient might be able to tell you if they experience stomach ache or not whereas they might not be able to tell you how severe it is.This is mainly because people have different pain endurance thresholds.

Please find the link to the questionaire here:

The data entered will be stored in a spreadsheet and this can added to any existing databases.

To assess the severity and detection of disease, I have created separated the forms into 4 sections:

1. Basic details: such as name, age, height, weight, presence of fever.
2. First stage sysmptoms: This part will assess if the patient is in first stage of the disease by if the patient answers yes for all the questions in this section, and no for rest of them, he/she might be suffering from first 
     stage of typhoid.
3. Second stage symptoms: If the patient answers 'YES' for all the questions in the above section and 'YES' for this section as well, he/she might be suffering from second stage of typhoid. The patient might answer 'NO' for the next section.
4: Third stage symptoms: If the patient answers 'YES' for all the questions in the above two sections and 'YES' for this section as well, he/she might be suffering from third stage of typhoid.

This form will easily help detect typhoid and its severity.
